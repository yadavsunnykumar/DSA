# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

Welcome to the **DSA Project**! This repository is dedicated to learning and implementing Data Structures and Algorithms using **JavaScript** and **Python**.

## Topics Covered

This project will cover the following topics:

- **Arrays**
- **Strings**
- **Queues**
- **Stacks**
- **Linked Lists**
- **Trees**
- **Graphs**
- **Sorting Algorithms**
- **Searching Algorithms**
- **Dynamic Programming**
- **Greedy Algorithms**
- **Backtracking**
